```    
$ dev_appserver.py .
```
3. Check running at
- Module "default" running at: http://localhost:8080. 
- Admin server at: http://localhost:8000.

```python
RANGE = 5
```

##### Set SECRET
You can modify the following in `settings.py` in `src`. 
```python
SECRET = 'your_secret_key'
```

##### Can change hash library
You can change hash methods in `util.py` in `src`/`handlers`.
```python
def hash_str(s):
    return hmac.new(SECRET, s).hexdigest()
``` python
and/or 
```
h = hashlib.sha256(name+pw+salt).hexdigest()
```

### Basic Branding

##### Set logo
Replace `0_logo.svg` in `src`/`img` with your logo file with the same name.

- Comment: `comment.py` in `models`
  - Comment entities [referenced](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/articles/modeling#one-to-many) to a Blog entity
