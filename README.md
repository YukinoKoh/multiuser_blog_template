## Set up
1. Install [Google Cloud SDK for Python](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart-mac-os-x)
    * Make sure that you can use gcloud command
2. Run app locally with the following command in `src` folder.
```    
$ dev_appserver.py .
```
3. Check running at
- Module "default" running at: http://localhost:8080. 
- Admin server at: http://localhost:8000.

4. Install [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/), if you want to use `Gruntfile.js` to run sass compiler.

## Usage

### [SECURITY] Modify hash codes for Security

##### Set SALT
You can modify the following in `settings.py` in `src`. 
```python
RANGE = 5
```

##### Set SECRET
You can modify the following in `settings.py` in `src`. 
```python
SECRET = 'your_secret_key'
```

##### Can change hash library
You can change hash methods in `util.py` in `src`/`handlers`.
```python
def hash_str(s):
    return hmac.new(SECRET, s).hexdigest()
```
and/or 
``` python
h = hashlib.sha256(name+pw+salt).hexdigest()
```

### Basic Branding

##### Set logo
Replace `0_logo.svg` in `src`/`img` with your logo file with the same name.

##### Set name
`sitename` in `notes.py` will be applied all pages in this app  
```
sitename = 'Your blog name'
```

##### Set color
`$color_brand` in `style.scss` in `sass` will be applied to link texts in this app 


### Database
This app as a default has 3 entity kinds: User, Blog, and Comment

- User: `user.py` in `models`
- Blog: `blog.py` in `models`
  - Blog entities [referenced](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/articles/modeling#one-to-many) to a User entity
- Comment: `comment.py` in `models`
  - Comment entities [referenced](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/articles/modeling#one-to-many) to a Blog entity

db.Model is inherited from [Model Class](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/datastore/modelclass).


## Deploy App Engine
1. Direct to `src` in terminal (if Mac).
2. Run the following command.
```
$gcloud app deploy
```
3. Follow the instruction to choose account, project to deploy.
